# Brushy: The Drawing Renderer

Brushy is a 2D drawing application designed for creative experimentation and rapid prototyping. It offers a simple interface for rendering shapes, lines, and text with precise control over color, size, and position. Brushy was developed using SDL2 and SDL_ttf, making it cross-platform and efficient.

This project started as an academic initiative by the authors during their Computer Graphics course at the University of Caxias do Sul.

The icon for this application was generated with DALLÂ·E, OpenAI's image generation artificial intelligence model.
