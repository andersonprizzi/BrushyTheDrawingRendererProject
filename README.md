# Brushy: The Drawing Renderer

Brushy is a 2D drawing application designed for creative experimentation and rapid prototyping. It offers a simple interface for rendering shapes, lines, and text with precise control over color, size, and position. Brushy was developed using SDL2 and SDL_ttf, making it cross-platform and efficient.

This project started as an academic initiative by the authors during their Computer Graphics course at the University of Caxias do Sul.
